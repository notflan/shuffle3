* shuffle3-lean
  Redegisn/upgrade of =shuffle3=

* Goals
  - [X] Functioning in-place shuffle/unshuffle
    - [X] Shuffle
    - [X] Unshuffle
  - [X] Usable in-place s/us from command line
    - [X] Shuffle
    - [X] Unshuffle
  - [ ] Functioning out-of-place/in-memory shuffle/unshuffle
    - [ ] Shuffle
    - [ ] Unshuffle
  - [ ] Usable out-of-place s/us from command line
    - [ ] Shuffle
    - [ ] Unshuffle

** NO compatibility with =shuffle3=
   =shuffle3='s ~drng~ PRNG algorithm uses an outdated global state backend. We don't want to reuse this.
   As a result, output from =shuffle3= and =shuffle3-lean= is different.

* Improvements
  - *~70-80x* speedup from shuffle3 1.0
  - Huge reduction in syscalls
  - Takes advantage of the kernel's fs cache
  - Can properly handle large files without core dumping
  - Doesn't dump huge amounts of trash onto each stack frame

* Todo
  - [X] impl rng
  - [X] impl shuffling
  - [ ] impl out-of-place shuffling
  - [-] arg parsing and dispatch
    - [X] simple parsing
    - [ ] complex parsing
